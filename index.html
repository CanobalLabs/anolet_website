      <h3>
        <small>Press Release | April 28, 2023 · FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</small><br>
        <b>Ottawa, CA ― Anolet acquired by Canobal Labs</b>
      </h3>
      
      As of April 27th, 2023, Anolet has joined forces with Canobal Labs, meaning Canobal Labs is now the parent company of Anolet.
      This change has been in progress for 2 weeks, but is now being formally announced. From now on, you'll see references to Canobal Labs in legal statements, login pages, and more.
      <br><br>
      Canobal Labs is a relatively new mobile game development company founded by Rus Price with 2 games under development. Canobal creates unique, exciting games that combine experimental
      technology with concepts that have been around for decades. With the help of the team at Canobal we'll be able to provide a high-quality experience for our players.
      Anolet will be a mobile-first game, with support for desktop.
      <br><br>
      You'll be able to use your account across all games provided by Canobal, with a shared microcurrency between them. If you are part of the alpha program, your Anolet accounts will soon
      be converted into a Canobal account. This should require no action on your part.
      <br><br>
      This collaboration will continue to pave the way to success for both Anolet and Canobal. The Anolet website will be offline until changes are made to accurately represent this acquisition.
