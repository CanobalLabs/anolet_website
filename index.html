        <h4>What's it all about?</h4>
        <a class="answer">Anolet is a massively multiplayer online 2D gaming platform. Woah, that's a mouthful. Let's
            try that again.<br><br>
            Anolet allows you to play and develop multiplayer 2D games for completely free. Throughout each game, you'll
            use your customizable Anolet avatar which can be changed at any time.<br><br>Using our marketplace, you can
            purchase accessories using Amulets and equip them to your Anolet avatar to represent <i>you</i>.
        </a>
    </div>
    <div class="qna">
        <h4>What are Amulets?</h4>
        <a class="answer">
            Amulets are Anolet's microcurrency. You can use Amulets to buy accessories, get powerups on your favorite
            games, and more. When you first create your Anolet account, we give you 200 Amulets to get started. You can
            purchase Amulets using real money, or earn Amulets by developing your own games.
        </a>
    </div>
    <div class="qna">
        <h4>We can create games too?? <img src="./pog.png" height="20"></h4>
        <a class="answer">
            Yes! You can use Anolet Workplace, our online Anolet IDE to easily create fun and intuitive games and deploy
            them for free to Anolet's global cloud infrastructure.<br><br>You can also use Javascript in combination
            with our API to create even more interactive games that players will love. Not familiar with Javascript?
            That's okay! Our IDE provides simple to use tools that get most jobs done, and we're always creating more
            tools.<br><br>You can earn Amulets for your hard work by adding powerups to your games. Powerups allow you
            to offer players in-game perks for an Amulet fee, of which 100% revenue goes to you.
        </a>
    </div>
    <div class="qna">
        <h4>Powerups? Sounds awesome, tell me more!</h4>
        <a class="answer">
            There are 3
            types of powerups: Single Use, Recurring, and Infinite Use. Single Use powerups can only be purchased once,
            and the perks last forever. This would be ideal for say access to a VIP-only zone in your
            game.<br><br>Infinite Use powerups can be purchased as many times as the user wants. This would be ideal for
            players purchasing coins in your game.<br><br>Recurring powerups are membership-style powerups. They offer
            perks for your game for a recurring Amulet fee. This can be charged monthly or weekly, you choose. The user
            can cancel their membership at any time, and they can subscribe to the membership again afterwards if they
            so choose. This is ideal for the same use cases as Single Use powerups, but if you want to make more
            Amulets.

        <h4>Are there any features Anolet is going to have that hasn't been mentioned here?</h4>
        <a class="answer">
           Yep, here's a quick rundown of them:<br><b>- Streaks:</b> Earn Amulets by logging in every day. Higher the streak, more Amulets you earn.<br><b>- Crates:</b> Buy crates on the marketplace, open them up, and receive an item. You could end up with a super rare item, or a super cheap item. There are multiple crates with varying levels of rare chance %.<br><b>- Groups: </b>Create your dream game business. Create games under your group, and hire developers to work on your games. It's a capitalist society, and it's time for you to take advantage of it.

    <div class="qna end">
        <h4>Is there any way to get early access?</h4>
        <a class="answer">
           Yes! If you want early access (who doesn't?), boost our Discord server twice, and you'll enjoy having exclusive alpha access to the website and client while your boosts last. <br><br>If you can't do that, check out this multiplayer preview of what a game on Anolet would look like down below, except you are using a preview-only guest account feature.
